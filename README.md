## Recommendation System

# Introduction
This project features a basic recommendation system with a closed set of users and games (meaning that we assume that there won't be new users added to the user database).

# Technologies
The model uses 'Singular Value Decomposition' algorithm to predict the ratings that the users will give to the games they have not tried yet. Therefore, it recommends the game with the highest predicted rate. The accuracy was not tested yet.

# Dependencies
The program can run on any machine with the following tools and resources:
* Python 3
* Pandas, Numpy, Scikit Learn Libraries
